  "description": "I am a hard-working, positive, easy going technophile who is continuously keen to learn new things in every single moment possible. I like to spend my free time with my own IT-projects. It would be greatly inspiring to work with people who - despite being the best of their specializations - remain humble and are interested to learn and find solutions together. My ambition is to help bring Nepal into the spotlight of IT world. My long-term career objective is to be a lead developer along with the knowledge of requirements engineering, data mining and IT risk analyst. I would love to be in a place that requires my people skills as well as my technical competence.",
