        My responsibilities are developing a frontend view in angular application and creating REST API‑based Jakarta EE application for STX product that handles post‑trade processes like clearing settlement, and corporate actions. Since our team is small, my assignment also involved providing first-line support and collecting user requirements from stakeholders.

          The thesis investigates the benefit of OPA over a specialized policy engine to existing cloud‑native applications named EMC and OMC running
          in a private cloud
        </li>
        <li>
          It was observed that there was almost small difference in latency i.e 10% slower in latency when service was integrated with OPA as
          SideCar. But in the case of fine‑grained authorization, as data grows, Wasm‑based system integration performs well i.e 30% faster than
          the existing authorization system.
        </li>
        <li>The thesis project involves Kubernetes, Open Policy agent, and some Java Security and Python Security programming, threat modeling when
          integrating with OPA with existing service.</li>
