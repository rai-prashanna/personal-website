title: My Background
---

Iâ€™m Prashanna Rai, a passionate technologist who has transitioned from a Full-Stack Developer to an Azure Data Engineer. 
My journey started with building end-to-end applications, where I developed a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, and system design. 
Over time, I became deeply interested in managing, transforming, and analyzing data to unlock business insights. 
Leveraging my full-stack background, I now specialize in designing and implementing scalable cloud-based data solutions on Microsoft Azure, focusing on tools like Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Databricks. 
My diverse skill set allows me to bridge the gap between application development and data engineering, ensuring seamless integration and optimal performance across systems.
