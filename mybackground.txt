I am soon to graduate from Uppsala University
in 2023. I did my Master’s thesis at Ericsson topic called Cloud native authorization.
My Master’s program is specialized in the area of Advance Software Design, Data Engineering, Parallel and Concurrent
Programming, and Advanced Computer Architecture.
e My study has helped me with a basic understanding of challenges in
Data‑Engineering, high‑level Software Development, Parallel and Concurrent Programming, and Advanced Computer Architecture.
Apart from my educational background, I have some working experience with Java applications and React applications from the industry. My thesis was related to work in Java programming and Python programming. I have some experience with c++ in university courses. I have demonstrated strength in understanding and handling complex technical issues of production service. I am confident that the skills I learned at my university will be tested here to the full extent and help me to bring feasible solutions. I would like to work with products and assignments that allow me to grow, both as a problem solver and as a person. Connecting to people and maintaining contacts is also something that I find stimulating. In my spare time, I like running. I try to be outdoors in nature as often as possible
and I love hiking.

I look forward to meeting you for an interview
